### Hi everyone, welcome to my clean, minimalist vision of design

![www.ana-am.es](http://www.ana-am.es/images/portadaGitHub.jpg)

Passionate, persevering, temperamental, determined... Of all the possible adjectives to define me, I have two that I was labelled with some time ago and seem to have been tailor-made for me: curious and inquisitive.
I was taught to be curious, to be restless, to look for solutions and to put passion into everything I undertake, whether on a personal or professional level. Attitudes that complete and define me.

I am an all-rounder in [offline graphic design](www.ana-am.es) (I'm updating my portfolio), I am always looking for new challenges that bring me growth and where I can also contribute. The online world has always attracted me and that's why I decided to become a front-end developer, because it's a sector in constant evolution, where I can keep learning and collaborating.

I am looking for a job where I can grow professionally, where my knowledge and previous experience are valued and where I can continue learning every day in a professional environment that allows me to advance.
